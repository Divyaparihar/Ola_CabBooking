## üßê About

The Ola cab booking project is a comprehensive transportation solution built using Java and Spring Boot for the backend, Next.js for the frontend, and MySQL for data storage. It enables users to book rides seamlessly by integrating real-time location tracking and route optimization. The Java-based Spring Boot backend facilitates efficient communication between the frontend and the database, ensuring secure data storage and retrieval. The Next.js frontend offers a dynamic user interface, enhancing the user experience with interactive features.

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
### Backend Prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later: [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- Spring Boot: [Getting Started with Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/)
- MySQL Database: [Download MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

### Frontend Prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Next.js: Install using npm: `npm install next`

## üîß Running the tests

To ensure the reliability and functionality of the Ola Cab Booking system, we have implemented automated tests that cover different aspects of the application.

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end (E2E) tests are designed to validate the complete flow of the application, simulating user interactions to ensure everything works seamlessly.

To run the E2E tests:
1. Ensure the backend and frontend are running.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `ola-cab`
3. Run the E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`

These tests cover scenarios like user registration, booking a ride, payment processing, and more.

### Coding Style Tests

Coding style tests, often referred to as linting, help maintain a consistent and clean codebase by highlighting code quality and style issues.

To run the coding style tests:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
2. Run the linting tests: `npm run lint`

These tests ensure that the code adheres to coding standards, making it easier to read and maintain.

### Example

For instance, an E2E test might simulate a user logging in, booking a ride, and verifying that the ride is correctly recorded in their booking history.

A coding style test could identify issues like improperly formatted code, missing semicolons, or unused variables, ensuring a unified coding style across the project.

Running these tests regularly ensures that the application remains functional and maintainable throughout its development lifecycle.

Feel free to explore the various features provided by the Ola Cab Booking system to make your rides hassle-free and convenient.


## üöÄ Deployment
To make your Ola cab booking web accessible to users, you need to deploy the Spring Boot application to a live server or a cloud platform.

I have deploy this project on github.


## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using

The Ola Cab Booking project is built using a combination of technologies and tools to provide a comprehensive and efficient transportation solution:

- **Backend:**
  - Java and Spring Boot for building the backend logic.
  - MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.

- **Frontend:**
  - Next.js framework for building the dynamic frontend.
  - HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for creating interactive user interfaces.

- **Testing:**
  - Automated tests for ensuring the functionality and reliability of the system.

- **Development Tools:**
  - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java and code editors for JavaScript/React.
  - Node.js and npm for package management.
